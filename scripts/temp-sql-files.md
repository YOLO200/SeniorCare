# Temporary SQL Files

These files were used during development to debug and fix RLS policy issues. They are kept here for reference but are no longer needed for the application to function.

## Files moved here:
- `fix-caregivers-rls.sql` - Added TO authenticated clause to policies
- `check-and-fix-rls.sql` - Diagnostic and fix script
- `remove-conflicting-policy.sql` - Removed conflicting policy
- `temp-disable-rls.sql` - Temporarily disabled RLS for testing

## Status:
These issues have been resolved and RLS is working properly. These files can be deleted if no longer needed.
